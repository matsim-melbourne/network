# Network generation data

This directory contains inputs files required to generate a MATSim network for Melbourne, which can be found [here](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/ssLkX8Uez64rV3D). Alternatively, you can use the `./prepare.sh` command as described below to download the data you need.

## How to populate

To populate this directory with the required data files, use the `./prepare.sh` with the relevant arguments. Valid arguments and their descriptions are presented in the table below:

| Argument | Input file                   | Description                                   |
|----------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| -region  | studyRegion.sqlite           | Greater Melbourne region                      |
| -osm19   | melbourne.osm                | Raw OSM file for Melbourne, 2019              |
| -melb    | melbourne.sqlite             | Road attributes                               |
| -net     | network.sqlite               | non-planar edges and nodes                    |
| -gtfs19  | gtfs_au_vic_ptv_20191004.zip | GTFS feed - 2019-10-04                        |
| -demx10  | DEMx10EPSG28355.tif          | Digital Elevation Model data (x10, EPSG28355) |
| -A       | all of the above             | It Will download all the input files, (~1.2gb)|

As an example, to start from processing raw OSM (step 1), and generating a network without elevation and public transport, you need to run the following to get the required input:
```
./prepare.sh -osm19
```

Alternatively, if you want to skip processing raw OSM and start directly from `makeNetwork.sh`, and generate a network that has elevation and PT network from GTFS, you need to run the following to download required inputs:
```
./prepare.sh -melb -net -gtfs19 -demx10
```
If you are not sure about which inputs are required, just simply run the following to download all the inputs:
```
./prepare.sh -A
```

If any issues with the script, please download each required file directly.
